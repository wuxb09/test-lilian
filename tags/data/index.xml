      <description>Here comes the Part 3 on learning with not enough data (Previous: Part 1 and Part 2). Letâ€™s consider two approaches for generating synthetic data for training.
 Augmented data. Given a set of existing training samples, we can apply a variety of augmentation, distortion and transformation to derive new data points without losing the key attributes. We have covered a bunch of augmentation methods on text and images in a previous post on contrastive learning.</description>

      <description>This is part 2 of what to do when facing a limited amount of labeled data for supervised learning tasks. This time we will get some amount of human labeling work involved, but within a budget limit, and therefore we need to be smart when selecting which samples to label.
Notations    Symbol Meaning     $K$ Number of unique class labels.   $(\mathbf{x}^l, y) \sim \mathcal{X}, y \in \{0, 1\}^K$ Labeled dataset.</description>

      <description>When facing a limited amount of labeled data for supervised learning tasks, four approaches are commonly discussed.
 Pre-training + fine-tuning: Pre-train a powerful task-agnostic model on a large unsupervised data corpus, e.g. pre-training LMs on free text, or pre-training vision models on unlabelled images via self-supervised learning, and then fine-tune it on the downstream task with a small set of labeled samples. Semi-supervised learning: Learn from the labelled and unlabeled samples together.</description>
