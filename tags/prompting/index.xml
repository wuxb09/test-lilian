      <description>Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.
Agent System Overview In a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent&amp;rsquo;s brain, complemented by several key components:</description>

      <description>Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights. It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.
This post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models.</description>
