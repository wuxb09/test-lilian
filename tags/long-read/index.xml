      <description>Many new Transformer architecture improvements have been proposed since my last post on &amp;ldquo;The Transformer Family&amp;rdquo; about three years ago. Here I did a big refactoring and enrichment of that 2020 post &amp;mdash; restructure the hierarchy of sections and improve many sections with more recent papers. Version 2.0 is a superset of the old version, about twice the length.
Notations    Symbol Meaning     $d$ The model size / hidden state dimension / positional encoding size.</description>

      <title>Large Transformer Model Inference Optimization</title>

      <description>[Updated on 2023-01-24: add a small section on Distillation.]
Large transformer models are mainstream nowadays, creating SoTA results for a variety of tasks. They are powerful but very expensive to train and use. The extremely high inference cost, in both time and memory, is a big bottleneck for adopting a powerful transformer for solving real-world tasks at scale.
Why is it hard to run inference for large transformer models? Besides the increasing size of SoTA models, there are two main factors contributing to the inference challenge (Pope et al.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Representation Learning</title>

      <description>The goal of contrastive representation learning is to learn such an embedding space in which similar sample pairs stay close to each other while dissimilar ones are far apart. Contrastive learning can be applied to both supervised and unsupervised settings. When working with unsupervised data, contrastive learning is one of the most powerful approaches in self-supervised learning.
Contrastive Training Objectives In early versions of loss functions for contrastive learning, only one positive and one negative sample are involved.</description>

      <description>[Updated on 2021-02-01: Updated to version 2.0 with several work added and many typos fixed.] [Updated on 2021-05-26: Add P-tuning and Prompt Tuning in the &amp;ldquo;prompt design&amp;rdquo; section.] [Updated on 2021-09-19: Add &amp;ldquo;unlikelihood training&amp;rdquo;.]
There is a gigantic amount of free text on the Web, several magnitude more than labelled benchmark datasets. The state-of-the-art language models (LM) are trained with unsupervised Web data in large scale. When generating samples from LM by iteratively sampling the next token, we do not have much control over attributes of the output text, such as the topic, the style, the sentiment, etc.</description>

      <title>Exploration Strategies in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>[Updated on 2020-06-17: Add &amp;ldquo;exploration via disagreement&amp;rdquo; in the &amp;ldquo;Forward Dynamics&amp;rdquo; section.
Exploitation versus exploration is a critical topic in Reinforcement Learning. We&amp;rsquo;d like the RL agent to find the best solution as fast as possible. However, in the meantime, committing to solutions too quickly without enough exploration sounds pretty bad, as it could lead to local minima or total failure. Modern RL algorithms that optimize for the best returns can achieve good exploitation quite efficiently, while exploration remains more like an open topic.</description>

A good machine learning model often requires training with a large number of samples. Humans, in contrast, learn new concepts and skills much faster and more efficiently. Kids who have seen cats and birds only a few times can quickly tell them apart. People who know how to ride a bike are likely to discover the way to ride a motorcycle fast with little or even no demonstration.</description>

Generative adversarial network (GAN) has shown great results in many generative tasks to replicate the real-world rich content such as images, human language, and music. It is inspired by game theory: two models, a generator and a critic, are competing with each other while making each other stronger at the same time.</description>
